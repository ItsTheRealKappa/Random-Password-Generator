### 🔐 PyPassword Generator

This is a simple Python password generator built using basic concepts from the first few days of the **"100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp"** by Angela Yu.

It allows the user to specify how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** they want in their password. The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists, combines them, and outputs a generated password.
